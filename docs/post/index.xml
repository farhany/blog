      <description>Alright, so I&amp;rsquo;ve fixed the SSL issue with CloudFront. Which rocks BTW.
There was still a JS file loaded that was loading the front page header image over http, which made the site lose the secure green lock in Chrome. Though Safari didn&amp;rsquo;t care. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t show a green lock icon anyway, unless the cert is EV based.</description>

      <description>Just picked up a BBC micro:bit. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun little toy. Liked it a lot more than an Arduino or a Raspberry PI. This thing is easy to get started with, in mere seconds.</description>

      <description>Since this is hosted on GitHub pages, it should be online all the time.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start fresh and not import my Wordpress site. That&amp;rsquo;s quote dated, and maybe one day, when I have ample time, I could look into the import process.
Only crappy thing with hosting this on GitHub is that you don&amp;rsquo;t get https with a custom domain. Oh well, at least there are no admin interfaces where passwords can be sniffed or man-in-the-middled.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of discussion on how PC Gaming will always be farther ahead of consoles.
That is true, but most worthwhile, AAA tiles are first available on consoles first. With the recent port of Destiny 2 to PC, I am greatly interested in it because it will support 60 frames per second even with a cheap $75 GTX 1060 card in 1080p. This is fine. I don&amp;rsquo;t need anything higher resolution at this time because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a 4K TV.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Wordpress fan since the mid-2000s. It was indeed the bee&amp;rsquo;s knees at that point. But times have changed and its time to re-hash a simple blog and host it on GitHub or GitLabs.</description>
