There has been a lot of discussion on how PC Gaming will always be farther ahead of consoles.

That is true, but most worthwhile, AAA tiles are first available on consoles first. With the recent
port of Destiny 2 to PC, I am greatly interested in it because it will support 60 frames per second even
with a cheap $75 GTX 1060 card in 1080p. This is fine. I don't need anything higher resolution at this time
because I don't have a 4K TV. I do, have a 4K monitor.
