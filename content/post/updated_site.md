As of lately, I've been busy with integrating SAML. Now that is mostly done, I can play Destiny 2 again. 
The third season is in, with a full DLC to be released in mid-September. Destiny 2 will run on PS5 at 60 FPS at 4K.
No need to re-purchase content. Though, I play on a gaming laptop, which is much better expereince, at frame rates of 144!

I do need to add a SSD SATA drive into the laptop, as I am running out of disk space for Steam games. Waiting for Black Friday, if I can.
