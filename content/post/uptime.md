Since this is hosted on GitHub pages, it should be online all the time.

Also, I've decided to start fresh and not import my Wordpress site. That's quote dated, and maybe
one day, when I have ample time, I could look into the import process.

Only crappy thing with hosting this on GitHub is that you don't get https with a custom domain. Oh well,
at least there are no admin interfaces where passwords can be sniffed or man-in-the-middled.

Do want want to find a better theme that allows comments maybe? If that's not a thing with static states,
and I highly doubt that it is, I will just look for a nicer theme with categories. 

For now, just learning `hugo`.
